# HPC_Cvode

Reference data from a methane-air triple flame, using gri3.0 chemical mechanism. 

Varibales as 'COXXX' represent mass fraction of species XXX.

TEMPE is the temperature.

ENTHA is the enthalpy. 

read.cpp - Contains function to read .csv (I am sure this can be improved)

'res_est.csv' corresponds to data from the 'ESTiMatE-Mech_04042022.xml' mechanims with kerosene as fuel 

'res_gri3.0.csv' corresponds to data from the 'gri30..xml' mechanims with Methane as fuel 

'res_h2.csv' corresponds to data from the 'h2_li_2004.xml' mechanims with Hydrogen as fuel
